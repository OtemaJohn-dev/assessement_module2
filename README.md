# RETRIEVIAL ARGUMENTED GENERATION AI SYSTEM

A Retrieval Augmented Generation system is an advanced architecture that combines retrieval based and generative methods in natural language processing (NLP). Itâ€™s primarily used to answer user queries or generate text by leveraging both large language models (LLMs) and external data sources.

# WHAT IS EXACTLY IN MY PROJECT

Basing on my project, A literture student can gain access to quick answers from the novel named Romeo and Juliet. That means a student or user can can prompt that RAG system and ask a specific question basing on the context provide to the system and he or she can get quick access to there answers.

# TECHNOLOGY USED

In this project I used langchain that is a framework used by dvelopers to build applications powered by large language model like Openai, GPT models GROQ AI among others. so during the process I installed using the command "python -m pip langchain-groq" because my project uses groq AI.

On using a llama model that provided me with less tokens yet the uploaded document produced more tokens than the model could support, to solve this issue I decided to chunk the text and I used chunking_evaluation strategy called ClusterSemanticChunker after which I created embeddings using OpenAIEmbeddings and then stored them in a vector database, and for this I decided to use chromadb

# Dockerization 

I decided to dockerize the streamlit app in a docker file and since the chromadb image already existed, I just created a docker-compose.yaml where I connected the the streamlit app to the chromadb that contained the embeddings creatied
