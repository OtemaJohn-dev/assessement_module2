Well, Susan is with God;\\nShe was too good for me. But as I said,\\nOn Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen;\\nThat shall she, marry; I remember it well.\\n’Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;\\nAnd she was wean’d,—I never shall forget it—,\\nOf all the days of the year, upon that day:\\nFor I had then laid wormwood to my dug,\\nSitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall;\\nMy lord and you were then at Mantua:\\nNay, I do bear a brain. But as I said,\\nWhen it did taste the wormwood on the nipple\\nOf my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,\\nTo see it tetchy, and fall out with the dug!\\nShake, quoth the dovehouse: ’twas no need, I trow,\\nTo bid me trudge.\\nAnd since that time it is eleven years;\\nFor then she could stand alone; nay, by th’rood\\nShe could have run and waddled all about;\\nFor even the day before she broke her brow,\\nAnd then my husband,—God be with his soul!\\nA was a merry man,—took up the child:\\n‘Yea,’ quoth he, ‘dost thou fall upon thy face?\\nThou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;\\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ and, by my holidame,\\nThe pretty wretch left crying, and said ‘Ay’.\\nTo see now how a jest shall come about.\\nI warrant, and I should live a thousand years,\\nI never should forget it. ‘Wilt thou not, Jule?’ quoth he;\\nAnd, pretty fool, it stinted, and said ‘Ay.’\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nEnough of this; I pray thee hold thy peace.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nYes, madam, yet I cannot choose but laugh,\\nTo think it should leave crying, and say ‘Ay’;\\nAnd yet I warrant it had upon it brow\\nA bump as big as a young cockerel’s stone;\\nA perilous knock, and it cried bitterly.\\n‘Yea,’ quoth my husband, ‘fall’st upon thy face?\\nThou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;\\nWilt thou not, Jule?’ it stinted, and said ‘Ay’.\\n\\nJULIET.\\nAnd stint thou too, I pray thee, Nurse, say I.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nPeace, I have done.

Were not I thine only nurse,\\nI would say thou hadst suck’d wisdom from thy teat.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nWell, think of marriage now: younger than you,\\nHere in Verona, ladies of esteem,\\nAre made already mothers. By my count\\nI was your mother much upon these years\\nThat you are now a maid. Thus, then, in brief;\\nThe valiant Paris seeks you for his love.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nA man, young lady!

Women grow by men.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nSpeak briefly, can you like of Paris’ love?\\n\\nJULIET.\\nI’ll look to like, if looking liking move:\\nBut no more deep will I endart mine eye\\nThan your consent gives strength to make it fly.\\n\\n Enter a Servant.\\n\\nSERVANT.\\nMadam, the guests are come, supper served up, you called, my young lady\\nasked for, the Nurse cursed in the pantry, and everything in extremity.\\nI must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight.\\n\\nLADY CAPULET.\\nWe follow thee.\\n\\n [_Exit Servant._]\\n\\nJuliet, the County stays.\\n\\nNURSE.\\nGo, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE IV.

It is too rough,\\nToo rude, too boisterous; and it pricks like thorn.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nIf love be rough with you, be rough with love;\\nPrick love for pricking, and you beat love down.\\nGive me a case to put my visage in: [_Putting on a mask._]\\nA visor for a visor. What care I\\nWhat curious eye doth quote deformities?\\nHere are the beetle-brows shall blush for me.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nCome, knock and enter; and no sooner in\\nBut every man betake him to his legs.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nA torch for me: let wantons, light of heart,\\nTickle the senseless rushes with their heels;\\nFor I am proverb’d with a grandsire phrase,\\nI’ll be a candle-holder and look on,\\nThe game was ne’er so fair, and I am done.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nTut, dun’s the mouse, the constable’s own word:\\nIf thou art dun, we’ll draw thee from the mire\\nOr save your reverence love, wherein thou stickest\\nUp to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nNay, that’s not so.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nI mean sir, in delay\\nWe waste our lights in vain, light lights by day.\\nTake our good meaning, for our judgment sits\\nFive times in that ere once in our five wits.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nAnd we mean well in going to this mask;\\nBut ’tis no wit to go.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nWhy, may one ask?\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI dreamt a dream tonight.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nAnd so did I.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nWell what was yours?\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nThat dreamers often lie.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nIn bed asleep, while they do dream things true.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nO, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.\\nShe is the fairies’ midwife, and she comes\\nIn shape no bigger than an agate-stone\\nOn the fore-finger of an alderman,\\nDrawn with a team of little atomies\\nOver men’s noses as they lie asleep:\\nHer waggon-spokes made of long spinners’ legs;\\nThe cover, of the wings of grasshoppers;\\nHer traces, of the smallest spider’s web;\\nThe collars, of the moonshine’s watery beams;\\nHer whip of cricket’s bone; the lash, of film;\\nHer waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,\\nNot half so big as a round little worm\\nPrick’d from the lazy finger of a maid:\\nHer chariot is an empty hazelnut,\\nMade by the joiner squirrel or old grub,\\nTime out o’ mind the fairies’ coachmakers.\\nAnd in this state she gallops night by night\\nThrough lovers’ brains, and then they dream of love;\\nO’er courtiers’ knees, that dream on curtsies straight;\\nO’er lawyers’ fingers, who straight dream on fees;\\nO’er ladies’ lips, who straight on kisses dream,\\nWhich oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,\\nBecause their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:\\nSometime she gallops o’er a courtier’s nose,\\nAnd then dreams he of smelling out a suit;\\nAnd sometime comes she with a tithe-pig’s tail,\\nTickling a parson’s nose as a lies asleep,\\nThen dreams he of another benefice:\\nSometime she driveth o’er a soldier’s neck,\\nAnd then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,\\nOf breaches, ambuscados, Spanish blades,\\nOf healths five fathom deep; and then anon\\nDrums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;\\nAnd, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two,\\nAnd sleeps again. This is that very Mab\\nThat plats the manes of horses in the night;\\nAnd bakes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,\\nWhich, once untangled, much misfortune bodes:\\nThis is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,\\nThat presses them, and learns them first to bear,\\nMaking them women of good carriage:\\nThis is she,—\\n\\nROMEO.\\nPeace, peace, Mercutio, peace,\\nThou talk’st of nothing.\\n\\nMERCUTIO.\\nTrue, I talk of dreams,\\nWhich are the children of an idle brain,\\nBegot of nothing but vain fantasy,\\nWhich is as thin of substance as the air,\\nAnd more inconstant than the wind, who woos\\nEven now the frozen bosom of the north,\\nAnd, being anger’d, puffs away from thence,\\nTurning his side to the dew-dropping south.\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nThis wind you talk of blows us from ourselves:\\nSupper is done, and we shall come too late.\\n\\nROMEO.\\nI fear too early: for my mind misgives\\nSome consequence yet hanging in the stars,\\nShall bitterly begin his fearful date\\nWith this night’s revels; and expire the term\\nOf a despised life, clos’d in my breast\\nBy some vile forfeit of untimely death.\\nBut he that hath the steerage of my course\\nDirect my suit. On, lusty gentlemen!\\n\\nBENVOLIO.\\nStrike, drum.\\n\\n [_Exeunt._]\\n\\nSCENE V. A Hall in Capulet’s House.\\n\\n Musicians waiting. Enter Servants.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT.\\nWhere’s Potpan, that he helps not to take away?\\nHe shift a trencher! He scrape a trencher!\\n\\nSECOND SERVANT.\\nWhen good manners shall lie all in one or two men’s hands, and they\\nunwash’d too, ’tis a foul thing.\\n\\nFIRST SERVANT.\\nAway with the join-stools, remove the court-cupboard, look to the\\nplate.
